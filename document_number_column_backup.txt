// Backup of Document Number column related code from Fabsi_List_of_Service.py

1. Original column definition in display_columns (from __init__ method):
self.display_columns = [
    "Select", "ID", "Stick-Built", "Module", "Document Number", "Activities", "Title", "Department",
    "Technical Unit", "Assigned to", "Progress", "Estimated internal",
    "Estimated external", "Start date", "Due date", "Notes", "Professional Role"
]

2. Document Number in SQL query (from on_project_selected method):
'''
SELECT
    s.id,
    sb.name AS "Stick-Built",
    m.name AS "Module",
    s.id AS "Document Number",  // This line maps the service ID to Document Number
    a.name AS "Activities",
    ...
'''

3. Document Number in column_widths configuration:
column_widths = {
    ...
    "Document Number": 65,
    ...
}

4. Usage in delete_selected method (for finding database IDs):
# Get the actual database IDs from the Document Number column
ids_to_delete = []
for row_idx in self.selected_rows:
    if row_idx < len(self.df) and 'Document Number' in self.df.columns:
        db_id = self.df.iloc[row_idx]['Document Number']
        if pd.notnull(db_id):  # Only add valid IDs
            ids_to_delete.append(int(db_id))

Note: The Document Number column was used to store and display the database ID (s.id) of each service record. 
This was important for operations like deletion where we need to know the database ID of the record.
The column was hidden to simplify the UI but the ID information is still maintained in the database.
